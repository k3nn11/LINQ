The Battleship Game

Task: develop the structure and entities needed for the game Battleship

Basic entities: playing field and ships

The playing field is a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
Ships represent a point or segment of a certain length. Ships can move at some speed in some direction.Ships can be military, auxiliary or mixed. Warships can fire, auxiliary ships - repair, mixed type - both fire and repair. Shot and repair have some range, which depends on the ship, but not on the type of action.
Ships are considered the same if they are of the same type, have the same speed and length (for segment ships). Comparing ships should be done using the "==" and "!=" operations, the "> < >= <=" operations should not be supported.Ships can be located on the playing field in any of the quadrants and have integer coordinates along the X and Y axes. It should be possible to add ships to the playing field, but only in empty spaces. Access to the ship on the playing field is carried out by an indexer, including a quadrant, module X and module Y.
The implementation of the ship and the playing field should include a convenient way to display its state in line form. The state of the playing field includes a list of all ships, sorted by distance from the center.
